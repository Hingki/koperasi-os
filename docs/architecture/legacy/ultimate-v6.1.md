# Ultimate v6.x — Legacy Orchestration Design

This document archives the original Ultimate v6.x orchestration concept
for Koperasi OS.

## Scope
Ultimate v6.x defines a long-term vision for:
- CI/CD orchestration
- Coverage enforcement
- Environment promotion
- Audit-grade workflows

## Status
- Archived (NOT active)
- NOT implemented in PowerShell
- NOT required for current development phase

## Reason for Archiving
Current focus is correctness, security, and feature completion
(member registration, RLS verification).

Ultimate v6.x is intentionally deferred to avoid premature complexity.

## Activation Criteria
This design may be revisited when:
- multiple developers are active
- infrastructure is Linux-based
- CI/CD maturity is required
- feature surface is stable

## Note
This is architectural memory, not executable code.
